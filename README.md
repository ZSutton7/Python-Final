# Final Assignment
Final Assignment for Python

## Purpose
Our client, Matthew Pogue from WSU Tech in Wichita, Kansas, requires a GUI program to facilitate administering exams to students. The program should automate the process of creating test structures and make it easy for students to access them.

## Scope of Work
The code will be added as a pull request from a different branch to the GitHub project (https://github.com/ZSutton7/Python-Final). The project will include source code, extra documents, and any necessary documentation. If there are any obstacles that force considerable changes or restructuring during development, a possible extension will be negotiated with the client.

## Deliverables
The deliverables for this project are:

- A modern, smooth, well-structured GUI application that provides all necessary information.
- A module with a parser for the test questions and answers that passes the data to another module to show the multiple-choice formatted questions and answers to the user.
- A class for testQuestion and testAnswer, each with unique properties that highlight the differences between them.
- Each test question must have a corresponding test answer. The correct test answer will have a specific characteristic that, when true or false, will display appropriately when the test is submitted.

## Timeline
Updates will be provided three times per week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The timeline of events is planned as follows:

- **Monday, Mar 6th:** Familiarize yourself with the chosen language for the project and begin creating mockups for the GUI.
- **Wednesday, Mar 8th:** Research on the language is completed, and a comprehensive design framework is written up, presented, and approved to begin production.
- **Friday, Mar 10th:** Code is written according to the style guide, and debugging begins.
- **Sunday, Mar 12th:** Implementation is complete, and the code is ready to be submitted to the repository.

## Compensation
Compensation for the completion of the project will begin on March 13, 2023 at exactly 1:03pm, CTS. Compensation is taken very seriously. In return for completion of the project, a lifetime payment plan of 1000 V-bucks will be deposited into my fortnite account every two weeks. Additionally, for every new presidential election, a deposit 0.0001 bitcoin will be airdropped to every member of the elected officials family and then swiftly distributed to every American family head of household immediately.
